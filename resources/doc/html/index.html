                        Dayon! is an open-source and cross-platform (JAVA) solution that allows for watching and
                        controlling a remote computer. In this sense, it is therefore very much similar to existing
                        remote desktop solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But I guess it's got some features that makes it valuable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You'll find more details on this <a href="quickstart.html">page</a>.

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <div id="features">

            <h3><img src="check.png" alt=""> Easy Setup</h3>

            <p>
                Dayon! is dedicated to people who are quite new in the computer world. There's no need
                to setup the network (i.e., no firewall setup, no router configuration, no NAT setup)
                on their computer. Dayon! is acting there as a client connecting to the monitoring
                computer. Since version 1.2, the assisted application can be started using a <b>single URL
                click</b> within you favorite WEB browser (i.e., Java Web Start) for an even better (and
                hopefully easiest) user experience.
            </p>

            <h3><img src="check.png" alt=""> Low Network Bandwidth</h3>

            <p>
                Dayon! is sending compressed and cached gray (up to 256 levels) pictures to minimize
                the network usage offering as much as possible a real-time experience over the Internet.
                Those pictures are far enough for monitoring and explaining the different menus, icons
                and discovering the computer setup, etc...
            </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Status (v1.2)</h2>

        <p>
            Dayon! is currently the result of very few days of implementation and as such is
            still quite un-mature. Many things can be improved in different areas. I'll improve
            it as soon as I need new features to support my relatives back home and as well if
            the community should have any interest in that tool.
        </p>

        <h2>Rational</h2>

        <p>
            I've developed Dayon! as I'm now living in the Philippines and communicating with my
            family and friends back in Europe over Skype. Unfortunately, they're using Windows Vista
            that I do not know at all and it's quite difficult for me to help them with very basic
            tasks (e.g., setup a scanner to send me some documents, cleanup the disks, email issues,
            virus warning, etc...).
        </p>

        <p>
            I did not want them to setup their firewall and DSL/cable router and NAT and whatever
            required so that I can access their machine using a remote desktop connection. So, I've
            decided to implement something very simple in my free time and at the same time take into
            account a low bandwidth and high latency network.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the way, Dayon! means Come In! in Visayas - the local dialect.
