## History

Dayon! was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

With his permission I moved the code base to GitHub, where it can easier be maintained.

## Releases

The ![latest version](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/releases) is v1.6.1 - released more than ten years after the initial release.

This version comes with a refreshed look and feel, improved Windows installers and uses updated libraries, fully Java 9+ compatible.

It is most likely the very last version which is boundled with a Java 8 based JRE.
