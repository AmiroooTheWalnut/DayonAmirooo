# Dayon
Dayon! - A cross-platform remote assistance solution for your family and friends

This great tool was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

With his permission I moved the code base to GitHub, where it can be maintained more easely.

## Releases

The latest version is 1.3 - released almost eight years after the previous version.

This version uses updated libraries, can handle Windows UAC-dialogs and huge screen resolutions, which were causing fatal errors in previous versions.

Previous releases can be found on the original project site: http://dayonhome.sourceforge.net/
