# Dayon
Dayon! - A cross-platform remote assistance solution for your family and friends

This great tool was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

He gave me the permission to move the code base from SourceForge to GitHub, where it can be maintained more easely.

The original site of the project can be found here: http://dayonhome.sourceforge.net/
