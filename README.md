Dayon! is an easy to use, cross-platform remote desktop assistance solution.

It consists of two parts - one for the assistant and one for the assisted. Both are included in one single package.
As quick launch versions for Windows, they are also available as individual binaries.

## Key features

- easy setup
- no router or network configuration needed on the assisted side
- friendly, multilingual user interface (de, en, es, fr)
- assistant and assisted functionality in same packet
- encrypted communication (TLS)
- cross-platform
- open source
- free (as hugs)

## History

Dayon! was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

With his consent, I have taken over the maintenance and further development of this software in late 2016.
I also moved the code base to GitHub, where it can easier be maintained.

## Releases

The ![latest version](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/releases) is v1.10.0 (Lucky Lobster) - released more than ten years after the initial release.

This version comes with a new connection protocol, allowing the clipboard to be shared between assisted and assistant.

It is most likely the very last version which is bundled with a Java 8 based JRE.

Have a look at ``pom.xml`` or ``build.xml`` for details and advanced options.
 
## Contributors
 
Any feedback and contributions are very welcome. 

You don't have to be a programmer!

For example translations for additional languages would make this app more useful for more earthlings - see: [src/main/java/mpo/dayon/common/babylon/Babylon.properties](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/blob/master/src/main/java/mpo/dayon/common/babylon/Babylon.properties) or [docs](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/tree/master/docs)

Some additional testing, especially on macOS would also be highly appreciated.
