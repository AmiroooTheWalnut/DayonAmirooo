## History

Dayon! was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

With his permission I moved the code base to GitHub, where it can easier be maintained.

## Releases

The ![latest version](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/releases/latest) is 1.4.3 - released more than eight years after the latest release of the original author.

This version uses updated libraries, can handle Windows UAC-dialogs and encrypts all its communication.
