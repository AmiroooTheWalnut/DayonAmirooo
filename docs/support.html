        <h3>Known Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There's currently no way to send certain key combinations to the assisted computer (e.g., <code>Ctrl-Alt-Del</code>).
            <li>Depending on the display/windows manager and JDK combination, the clipboard content
                does not get copied into the recipients clipboard. So pasting (<code>Ctrl + v</code>) does have no effect.<br>
                In most cases the content is nonetheless transferred - take a look at the <code>/tmp</code> directory and
                look for a uuid folder (something like <code>68abde33-dd0d-4527-ab5c-fe4bbbec4d42</code>). There you will find the
                transferred clipboard files.
        </ul>
        <h3>Automatic connection of the assisted</h3>
        <p>
            The host name or IP address and port of the assistant can be passed via command line parameters:<br>
            <code>dayon_assisted ah=example.com ap=4242</code> (Linux/Mac OS)<br>
            Installed as a snap, the command is <code>dayon.assisted ah=example.com ap=4242</code>, installed
            from a .tgz archive: <code>./dayon_assisted.sh ah=example.com ap=4242</code> (Linux)<br>
            <code>java -jar dayon.jar ah=example.com ap=4567</code> (Windows)<br>
            or for the Quick Launch version:<br>
            <code>dayon_assisted.exe ah=example.org ap=80</code><br>
            If the assistant is started with these parameters, then he connects directly to the given host without further inquiry.
        <h3>Dayon! Home Directory</h3>
        <p>
            The directory <code>.dayon</code> is created within the default home directory of the logged in user or within
            the directory referenced by the JAVA property <code>user.home</code> and contains the saved user preferences
            and default log file(s).
        <h3>CRC Checksum</h3>
        <p>
            On the assisted side, the screen is divided into different areas called <em>tiles</em>. Only tiles that have
            changed from the previous capture are sent over the network to the assistant side. To determine if a tile is
            different I'm currently computing a
            CRC code (i.e., a unique integer value representing the pixels of the tile) that is not perfect for the sake
            of speed. So it might happens that some <em>changed</em> tiles are not sent to the assistant.
        <p>
            Until now I've detected that issue during strong testing for very few pixels. Visually, I've not noticed
            anything serious. But in case things are going mad you can then restart the assisted or before try the
            <code>reset</code> action (<strong>trash bin icon</strong>) that should clear every cached data and resend a full
            screen capture from scratch.
        <h3>Statistics Counters</h3>
        <img src="stats_counters.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Statistics">
        <p>The status bar of the assistant frame is displaying a set of counters.
        <ol>
            <li>Network Bandwidth
            <li>Compression Ratio: how many times the initial capture (diff only) has been compressed
            <li>Number of Tiles: the number of tile being transmitted over the network as well as the cache hits.
            <li>Number of Skipped Capture: the number of screen captures that have been skipped because of a too high
                rate (i.e., low tick value) for the CPU. To minimize that number you have to slow down the capture rate
                using a bigger tick value.
            <li>Number of Merged Capture: the number of screen captures that have been merged before being transmitted.
                This is due to a capture rate too high for the current compression method. To minimize that number you
                have to slow down the capture rate and/or change the compression method using a faster one.
            <li>Memory usage
            <li>Duration of the active or the last support session
        </ol>
