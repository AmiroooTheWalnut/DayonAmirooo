        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>
            Use the following <a href="https://github.com/retgal/dayon/releases">page</a> to download the lastest
            package according to your platform.
        <p>
            Legacy releases (v1.0 to v1.2) can be downloaded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=246651">here</a>.
        <p>
            <b>Windows:</b> two installers are available and the installation should be straightforward. One package
            comes bundled with an OpenJDK 1.8 based JRE and one without. The one with included JRE is for 64bit versions
            of Windows only.<br>
            Since release 1.9 there also exist two separate "quick launch" versions. One for the assistant and one for
            the assisted part. These two portable versions do not require to be installed. In order to avoid possible
            problems with user account control in these versions, it is recommended to start the assistant with
            administrator rights.
        <p>
            <b>Debian & Ubuntu:</b> the <code>.deb</code> package can be installed using the software installer provided
            by your operating system. Alternatively you may install it by executing <code>sudo dpkg -i dayon*.deb</code>.
        <p>
            <b>Linux:</b> you have to <code>tar xzvf</code> the package. Run the script <code>setup.sh</code>, located
            in the target directory. The location of the installed JRE/JDK is going to be detected automatically. It is
            not bundled in the tgz. If it should
            for whatever reason fail to do so, then you can set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> in
            (<code>bin/dayon_run.sh</code>) manually. Note that, I've been testing this on various Debian and Ubuntu
            releases only.
        <p>
            <b>Mac OS/OS X:</b> extract the package to a location of your choice. For more convenience you may want to
            create an alias for bin/dayon_assisted and bin/dayon_assistant and copy them to your desktop. (JDK 1.8 or
            greater required)
